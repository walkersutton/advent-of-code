# AOC 2020 - Day 2

[instructions](https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/2)

### Part 1

> Each line gives the password policy and then the password. The password policy indicates the lowest and highest number of times a given letter must appear for the password to be valid. For example, 1-3 a means that the password must contain a at least 1 time and at most 3 times.
>
> How many passwords are valid according to their policies?

### Part 2

> Each policy actually describes two positions in the password, where 1 means the first character, 2 means the second character, and so on (1-indexing). Exactly one of these positions must contain the given letter. Other occurrences of the letter are irrelevant for the purposes of policy enforcement.
>
> How many passwords are valid according to the new interpretation of the policies?
