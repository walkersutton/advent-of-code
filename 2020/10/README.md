## IS THIS DAY 9 OR 10

### Part 1

> XMAS starts by transmitting a preamble of 25 numbers. After that, each number you receive should be the sum of any two of the 25 immediately previous numbers.
>
> The first step of attacking the weakness in the XMAS data is to find the first number in the list (after the preamble) which is not the sum of two of the 25 numbers before it. What is the first number that does not have this property?

### Part 2

> You must find a contiguous set of at least two numbers in your list which sum to the invalid number from step 1.
>
> Add together the smallest and largest number in this contiguous range. What is this value?
