[instructions](https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/15)

### Part 1

> In this game, the players take turns saying numbers. They begin by taking turns reading from a list of starting numbers (your puzzle input). Then, each turn consists of considering the most recently spoken number:
>
> * If that was the first time the number has been spoken, the current player says 0.
> * Otherwise, the number had been spoken before; the current player announces how many turns apart the number is from when it was previously spoken.
>
> What will be the 2020th number spoken?

### Part 2

> What will be the 30000000th number spoken?
