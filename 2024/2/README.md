[instructions](https://adventofcode.com/2024/day/2)

### Part 1

> a report only counts as safe if both of the following are true:
> * The levels are either all increasing or all decreasing.
> * Any two adjacent levels differ by at least one and at most three.
> How many reports are safe?

### Part 2

> The Problem Dampener is a reactor-mounted module that lets the reactor safety systems tolerate a single bad level in what would otherwise be a safe report. It's like the bad level never happened! How many reports are now safe?
