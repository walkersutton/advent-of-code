### Part 1

> A value like +6 means the current frequency increases by 6; a value like -3 means the current frequency decreases by 3.
>
> Starting with a frequency of zero, what is the resulting frequency after all of the changes in frequency have been applied?

### Part 2

> What is the first frequency your device reaches twice?
> 
> Note that your device might need to repeat its list of frequency changes many times before a duplicate frequency is found, and that duplicates might be found while in the middle of processing the list.
