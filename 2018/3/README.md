### Part 1
> Each Elf has made a claim about which area of fabric would be ideal for Santa's suit. The problem is that many of the claims overlap, causing two or more claims to cover part of the same areas.
>
> How many square inches of fabric are within two or more claims?

### Part 2
> You notice that exactly one claim doesn't overlap by even a single square inch of fabric with any other claim.
>
> What is the ID of the only claim that doesn't overlap?
